Hey there! My name is Harsh Krishna and I am a 21 year old college student studying economics in Universität Bonn. I have completed my Bachelors in Economics with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Delhi. I am aiming to pursue a career in academic research working on questions in Macroeconomics and Economic Growth. When I'm not busy with school work, I spend my time all around obssessing over the sport of football. 

I have been an active member of the twitter football/soccer analytics community since the April of 2021, making **data visualizations**, talking **tactics** and sharing a general love of the game with several different people. The main programs I work with are **RStudio**, **VS Code** and **Tableau Public**. This website serves as a place where all my work can be easily accessed.
