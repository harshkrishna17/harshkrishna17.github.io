This is a collection of my best work and open source projects I have contributed to. 

(PS. The title's are links. Click on them!)

## [ggshakeR](https://abhiamishra.github.io/ggshakeR/)

An analysis and visualization R package that works with publicly available soccer data.

- Added functions `plot_pizza`, `plot_trendline` and `plot_timeline` to the **ggshakeR** package allowing user's to plot graphs with minimal code in R.
- Contributed additional features to function `plot_shot` that allows user's to plot player shot maps. 
- Helped with the creation of the package's website, *writing guides* for the usage of specific functions. 

## [Player Finishing Overview](https://harshkrishna.shinyapps.io/PlayerFinishingOverview/?_ga=2.261886797.1933554447.1646064464-894996437.1645865622)

- Interactive web app that generates a dashboard of visualizations that can be useful in getting an overview of a football player's finishing ability.
- Deployed using shinyapps.io on free tier.
- [Link to the GitHub repo so that the app can be deployed on local system.](https://github.com/harshkrishna17/PlayerFinishingOverviewShiny)

## [Clustering soccer passes using k-means](https://github.com/harshkrishna17/K-means-Clustering-of-Passes-in-R)

- Clustered football player passes using the k-means algorithm. The data from the StatsBomb open dataset. 
- Created two different designs of plots, inspired by work seen on twitter.

## [xG Model](https://github.com/harshkrishna17/xG-Model-in-R) 

Created an xG model in R using tidymodels.

- xG Model using Understat data. Variables used included shot distance, angle as well as the body part used to take the shot.

## [Shot Centrality](https://github.com/harshkrishna17/Shot-Centrality)

- A project to quantitatively determine the **closeness and centrality of a shot to the centre of the goal**. 
- This works on Understat shot event data and uses the method of standard deviation from a set point to derive the values.

## [Community Help](https://twitter.com/placehoIder2004)

- I have been a regular member of the football/soccer analytics community on twitter, regularly making my code to make visualizations *open source*. 
- Here are two repositories with code to create football specific visualizations :-

1. [ggplot2-code](https://github.com/harshkrishna17/R-Code)
2. [matplotlib-code](https://github.com/harshkrishna17/matplotlib-code)

- Here is a repository that shows the implementation of machine learning techniques in R.
